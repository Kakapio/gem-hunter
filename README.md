# gem-hunter
A project that builds on my room-generator and makes a simple gem-collecting game. Upon collecting all the gems in a level, a new one is generated. Use arrow keys to move.

## technicals

Project was implemented with Monogame and FontStashSharp. Monogame was used to render/update game loop and to receive input. FontStashSharp was used to render text.
